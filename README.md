Did you ever buy a skin product which gave you an adverse reaction? Buying skin care products is like buying a car. You don't know if a product is suitable for your skin, what if a product doesn't go well with other products you are using and what if the product is not ethical? You can cook a nice dinner before answering these questions. It doesn't have to be like that.

Bloom is a rating platform that takes the guess work out of your skin care product purchases. On average, one skin care product has more than 30 ingredients. With the help of dermatologists, we review every single ingredient and then calculate efficacy and safety rating of each ingredient. Based on that we calculate efficacy and safety rating of a single product.
